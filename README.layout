As far as most users are concerned all files start from '/'.

If you are browsing then wander around the computing/ (or one of the other)
main directories.  If you are after a specific collection then it is probably
fastest to find either in the packages/ directory or to ask archie.
Archie can be reached by telnet (or spad) to archie.doc.ic.ac.uk.

All the directories other* are additional physical disks.
You should only use the logical structure!  Don't wander
around the other* directories as they are a bit of a mess.

file/		is a directory
file@		is a symlink
If the comment field contains "IGNORE" then this file is probably just
some weird thing I decided I needed locally.  Ignore it.
